## Petrol-Price-Forecasting-Project

# Overview
This project aims to forecast petrol prices for upcoming dates using time series analysis. We employ two models, LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average), to predict future petrol prices based on historical data.

# Data
The project utilizes a CSV file containing historical petrol price data. The dataset includes features such as date and petrol price values.

# Usage
- **Data Preparation**: Ensure the CSV file containing the petrol price data is in the correct format.
- **Data Analysis**: Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize and understand the data.
- **Model Training (LSTM)**: Implementation of the LSTM model for forecasting petrol prices. LSTM is chosen for its capability to capture long-term dependencies in 
                             time series data.Run the provided Jupyter notebook or Python script to train the LSTM model on the data.
- **Model Training (ARIMA)**: Implementation of the ARIMA model for forecasting petrol prices. ARIMA is chosen for its effectiveness in modeling and predicting 
                              time series data with trends and seasonality.Run the provided Jupyter notebook or Python script to train the ARIMA model on the data.
- **Prediction**: Use the trained models to predict future petrol prices.
- **Model Saving**: Save the trained models using pickle for future use.

# Results
The project aims to provide accurate predictions of petrol prices for future dates, assisting in better planning and decision-making.
